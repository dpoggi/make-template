# make-template

Project template for using GNU make, optionally with some fun OS X things too. Please, please, please do not use this for anything that will be distributed - look to autotools, CMake, SCons, etc. Mostly for my own use, doing mostly nothing at all.

## `thing.c`

Decided that I wanted to leave an example of using both traditional POSIX libraries and OS X frameworks in this template, so this is an utterly useless program that does just that.
